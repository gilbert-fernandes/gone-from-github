# gone-from-github

Github has become a huge part of the free, open-source development environment. But since Microsoft bought Github, things have been going down a slippery slope, slowly and I cannot use this service anymore.

Microsoft has been using Github content to feed Copilot. They use this to make money on the back of FOSS developers, without giving anything back, and even worse : by violating open-source projects licences. The code that Copilot spits out comes from, has been trained from, FOSS code which comes with GPL or alike licenses. Those are thrown out by Microsoft when giving code back through Copilot. By their very own admission, they have trained their software on a huge pile of GPL licensed code, yet they have their tool spit out code to people while REMOVING the open-source licenses that protect our contributions to the FOSS world.

Github has refused all requests to list the repositories they have injected into the training set of Copilot. We know that copyleft code has been injected into Copilot in at least 700 000 cases. Former Gnome developer and Github CEO, Nat Friedman, has declared publically that he considers the training of ML systems like Copilot to be "fair use". Nat, Github, Microsoft and their lawyers have ignored Software Freedom Conservancy's requests for explanations. Nat even replied that they consider the output of Copilot to be free of any licensing concerns, and that that code can be licensed under ANY LICENSE. So we write Copyleft code, Copilot gets trained on it, and then Copilot feeds on our work to spit out code while SUPPRESSING the Copyleft licenses we have build all FOSS with. Thomas Dohmke who replaced Nat Friedman, neve retracted or clarified Friedman's comments.

As Tim Davis has even shown :

@github copilot, with "public code" blocked, emits large chunks of my copyrighted code, with no attribution, no LGPL license. For example, the simple prompt "sparse matrix transpose, cs_" produces my cs_transpose in CSparse. My code on left, github on right. Not OK.

Microsoft never changed. They are a cancer in our world and them buying Github has tainted and infected it with the aim of destroying FOSS and Copyleft licensed code. Embrace and Estinguish all over gain.

Do not use Github. Do not give money to Microsoft. Do not let them feed on Copyleft code and make money out of it, stealing from our opensource work.
